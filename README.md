# CodeSamples
Samples of some of the work that I've done.

## Python
> The Python sample is an ETL process for loading Hosted (static) Feature and Vector Tile services into ESRI's ArcGIS Portal. The process is written in Python 3.6.

## .NET
> The Controller and Data Access Layer Service I've posted are part of a web service which is hit with parameters of an X and Y coordinate from the state plane, and return data that intersects with that point. 

## PL/SQL
> The Oracle PL/SQL package is hit by the above Data Access Layer Service, and does the heavy lifting to match up the coordinates to intersecting data.

## Javascript 
> This script is part of a web application that presents utility data to clients. This script handles the AJAX call to a hosted feature service and returns the data via embedded HTML in a pop up to the Map object.
